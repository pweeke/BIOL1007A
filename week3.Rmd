# Using publicly available data

#### 1. Go to [Dryad](https://datadryad.org/search) to choose a published paper and data set and reconstruct your own figure. Code a `ggplot` graph that looks as close to the published figure as you can.


#### 2. Perform a simple analysis (linear regression, ANOVA, t-test, chi-squared, or logistic regression) using two variables from the data set. Print the analysisâ€™ summary table.

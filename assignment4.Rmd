# Question One
```{r}
##assign the variable n_dims a single random integer between 3 and 10
n_dims <- sample(3:10, size=1)
n_dims

##vector of consecutive integers from 1 to n_dims2
MyVec <- c(1:n_dims^2)
MyVec

##use the sample function to randomly reshuffle these values
MyVec <- sample(MyVec)
MyVec

##create a square matrix with these elements
zMat <- matrix(data = MyVec, ncol = n_dims, byrow = T)

##print out the matrix
print(zMat)

##find a function in r to transpose the matrix
zMat <- t(zMat)

##print it out (flips the matrix across the central digonal line)
print(zMat)

##sum of first and last row
sum(zMat[c(1, n_dims),])

##mean of first and last row
mean(zMat[c(1, n_dims),])

##my n_dims is a random, so rerunning the code creates a different matrix
```

#### Simulate a brand new data frame (the type of data is up to you) and conduct a statistical analysis in R using 2 variables. Create a basic ggplot that goes with the analysis.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
Height <- rnorm(100, mean = 174.36, sd = 34.77)
Mass <- rnorm(100, mean = 97.31, sd = 169.46)
## These values came from the starwars dataset
Species <- rep(c("Human", "Droid", "Wookie", "Hutt"), each = 25)

Data <- data.frame(Species, Height, Mass)

MassHeight <- lm(Height ~ Mass, data=Data)
summary(MassHeight)

MHgraph <- ggplot(data=Data, aes(x=Height, y=Mass, color=Species)) +
  geom_point(size=2) +
  stat_smooth(method="lm")

MHgraph

## I assigned species randomly so there is no relationship. 
```

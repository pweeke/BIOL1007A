# Code Reflection
#### 1. Go through your recent assignments and the posted solutions ([Assignment 6 posted solutions](https://lvash.github.io/BIOL1007A/Assignment-6-dplyr_solutions.html) and [Weekly Assignment 2 solutions](https://lvash.github.io/BIOL1007A/Solutions_Weekly-Assignment-2.html)) - compare your code to the posted code.
  - Can you run your simulated data function with new values for the means? If not, what do you need to change about your code?
  - Are there differences between the posted code and yours? Did you notice you were missing anything?
  - Make sure you annotate your code using `#` and leave brief descriptions of your thought process.

I copied my original submissions for [Assignment 6](assignment6.html) and [Weekly Assignment 2](week2.html) (linked here) and created new R Markdowns with the answers to the questions (linked below):

  - [Weekly Assignment 2 Annotated](weeklyassignment2annotated.html)

# Code annotation

#### 2. I used `dryad` data to reconstruct a publication-quality figure. Copy my code into an Rmd file and annotate what each `ggplot` line of code is doing, including any arguments. You can use a combination of googling and ‘trial/error coding:’ change the arguments/options to visually see how it affects the plot.

dryadData <- read.table("Data/veysey-babbitt_data_amphibians.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)

# glimpse(dryadData)
